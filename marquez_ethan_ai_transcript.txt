Assignment: Comparing Agile and Waterfall Development Processes with AI Assistance

Overview

In this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience applying two different software development processes — Agile (Scrum-inspired) and Waterfall — while developing the same small-scale software system. To enrich the experience, students will also use ChatGPT (or a similar AI assistant) as a simulated project assistant for requirements gathering, design, coding support, and testing.

At the end, each group will present their software, process

artifacts, and reflections on how the chosen methodology influenced the

outcome.

Project Theme

A “Study Buddy” scheduling app for Clemson students:


Students can create a profile with courses they are enrolled in.

They can search for and schedule study sessions with classmates.

Features: add/remove availability, suggest matches, and confirm meetings.

Implementation: A command-line or web app in a chosen programming language

Process Requirements

Group A: Waterfall

Requirements Phase:

Use ChatGPT to help write a formal Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

No changes allowed after approval.

Design Phase:

Use ChatGPT to create UML diagrams, pseudocode, or architectural sketches.

Implementation Phase:

Write the full system in one pass, strictly based on the design.

Testing Phase:

Develop and execute test cases at the very end.

Group B: Agile (Scrum-style)

Sprint Planning:

Use ChatGPT to help write user stories and acceptance criteria.

Maintain a product backlog.

Iterations (3 X 1 day sprints):

Implement a subset of features each sprint.

Test continuously.

Keep a short daily stand-up log (progress, blockers, next steps).

Review & Retrospective:

Adjust backlog after each sprint.

AI Use

Students must use ChatGPT for at least three distinct tasks (e.g., requirements drafting, generating test cases, refactoring code).

They must critically evaluate outputs (not just copy-paste).

Document all interactions with ChatGPT (screenshots, transcripts, or summaries).

Deliverables

Codebase (functional program) in github with a 2-3 minute video walk through of function and features

Process Artifacts

Waterfall: SRS, design docs (UML/pseudocode), test plan & results

Agile: backlog, user stories, sprint plans, stand-up logs, retrospective notes

AI Usage Report (1 page): Describe how ChatGPT was used, what was helpful, what required correction.

Reflection Report (1-2 pages, team-authored):

Strengths & weaknesses of the process used

Comparison of actual vs. expected outcomes

How ChatGPT influenced requirements, design, coding, and testing

Grading Rubric (100 points)

My Kaltura



I am on Team B - Agile

Of course. Let's get started on your "Study Buddy" app using the Agile process.

The first step is Sprint Planning, which involves creating a Product Backlog with user stories. Here's a starting point based on the project theme.

## Product Backlog: Initial User Stories

Here are some initial user stories and acceptance criteria for your "Study Buddy" app. We can prioritize them and add more detail for your first sprint.

Epic: User Profile Management

    Story 1 (High Priority): As a Clemson student, I want to create a profile and list my courses, so that others can find me for study sessions.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Given I'm a new user, I can sign up with my name and Clemson email.

            Given I have a profile, I can add courses by course code (e.g., CPSC 3720).

            Given I have added courses, they are saved and visible on my profile.

Epic: Scheduling & Availability

    Story 2 (High Priority): As a student, I want to set my weekly availability, so that the app knows when I am free to study.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Given I am logged in, I can view a weekly calendar (e.g., Monday-Sunday).

            Given I view the calendar, I can select and save time blocks when I am available.

            Given my availability is saved, it can be used for matching.

    Story 3 (Medium Priority): As a student, I want to search for classmates enrolled in the same course, so that I can initiate a study session.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Given I am on the search page, I can select one of my courses.

            Given I select a course, the app displays a list of other students in that course.

            Given a list of students is shown, I can view their available times.

    Story 4 (Medium Priority): As a student, I want to propose and confirm a study session with a classmate, so that we can formalize a meeting.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Given I have found a classmate, I can send them a study session request with a proposed time.

            Given I receive a request, I can either accept or decline it.

            Given a request is accepted, it is confirmed and appears on both students' schedules.

## Next Steps

This backlog is your starting point. For your first 1-day sprint, you might want to focus only on Story 1.

How would you like to proceed? We can:

    Refine the acceptance criteria for Story 1.

    Generate pseudocode for creating a user profile.

    Draft some automated test cases for the profile creation feature.

Just let me know what your team needs for your sprint! Also, remember to document this interaction for your AI Usage Report. 👍

Can you explain the deliverables, I am not sure what they should look like. The backlog is filled with the user stories, which you have provided above, but what about the others?

backlog, user stories, sprint plans, stand-up logs, retrospective notes

Of course. Let's break down what each of those Agile artifacts should look like for your project.

## Backlog & User Stories

You're right, the product backlog is essentially a prioritized list of all the user stories. What I provided is a great starting point. As a team, you'll want to refine these, add more, and order them based on what delivers the most value first.

    What it looks like: It can be as simple as a shared document or a spreadsheet. Many teams use tools like Trello or Jira. For your project, a simple text file or Google Doc would be perfectly fine.

        Columns could be: Story Title, Description, Priority (High, Medium, Low), and Status (To Do, In Progress, Done).

## Sprint Plan

A sprint plan is your team's commitment for a single sprint (in your case, one day). It's a subset of the product backlog that you believe you can complete.

    What it looks like: At the beginning of each day (your sprint), you'll have a brief meeting to decide which user stories from the top of the backlog you will work on. The sprint plan is simply a list of those chosen stories.

        Example for Sprint 1 (Day 1):

            Sprint Goal: "A user can create a profile and add their courses."

            Stories:

                Story 1: "As a Clemson student, I want to create a profile and list my courses..."

            Tasks:

                Design the user profile data structure.

                Write the code for user registration.

                Implement the "add course" feature.

                Write and run tests for profile creation.

## Stand-Up Log

The daily stand-up is a very short meeting (usually 15 minutes) to sync up. Since your sprints are only one day, you might hold this mid-day or just keep a running log. The purpose is to communicate, not to solve problems.

    What it looks like: A simple, shared document where each team member answers three questions every day:

        What did I accomplish since the last stand-up?

        What will I work on until the next stand-up?

        What is blocking my progress?

        Example Log Entry:

            Date: 2025-09-04

            Team Member: Alex

            Yesterday's Work: "I finished the code for user registration."

            Today's Plan: "I will implement the 'add course' feature."

            Blockers: "None right now."

## Retrospective Notes

The retrospective happens at the very end of a sprint. It's a meeting where the team reflects on the process itself, not the product. What went well? What didn't? What will you change for the next sprint?

    What it looks like: These are just the meeting notes from that discussion. You should capture the key points.

        Example Retrospective Notes for Sprint 1:

            Date: 2025-09-04

            What went well?

                "We communicated well on the profile feature."

                "The AI-generated test cases saved us a lot of time."

            What could be improved?

                "We didn't have a clear idea of the database structure at the start."

            Action Items for next sprint:

                "For the next feature, we will ask the AI to help us sketch out the database schema before we start coding."

These documents don't need to be fancy. The key is that they are clear, concise, and show evidence of your team following the Agile process. 📝

Write test cases that apply to User Story two for the added codebase within the tests/test_profile.py

## Sprint 1: Profiles & Availability


### Planned Features

- Students can create a profile with name, email, and enrolled courses.

- Students can add/remove their weekly availability.


### Implementation

- Build simple CLI or web forms for entering data.

- Store profile and availability in a basic data structure (JSON or database).


### Testing

- Verify profile creation works with valid/invalid inputs.

- Confirm availability updates persist after save.


### Stand-Up Log (Sample)

- **Progress**: Profile creation implemented.  

- **Blockers**: Availability input format confusion (HH:MM vs. blocks).  

- **Next Steps**: Standardize time format.


---


## Sprint 2: Matching & Suggestions


### Planned Features

- System suggests potential study partners based on overlapping availability and courses.

- Display match results in a readable format.


### Implementation

- Matching algorithm compares student schedules.

- Integrate with availability from Sprint 1.


### Testing

- Test with overlapping vs. non-overlapping schedules.

- Ensure multiple matches appear sorted by best overlap.


### Stand-Up Log (Sample)

- **Progress**: Matching logic implemented for 2 users.  

- **Blockers**: Handling larger groups (3+ users).  

- **Next Steps**: Extend to multiple matches, refine sorting.


---


## Sprint 3: Meeting Confirmation & Polish


### Planned Features

- Students can send/accept meeting requests.

- Confirmed sessions are logged for both users.

- Clean up user interface / command flow.


### Implementation

- Add confirmation system (simple yes/no prompt or clickable option).

- Store confirmed meetings in a separate structure.

- Polish code and comments for final demo.


### Testing

- Verify confirmation works with multiple requests.

- Test declining vs. accepting requests.

- Regression test: ensure profiles and matching still function.


### Stand-Up Log (Sample)

- **Progress**: Confirmation logic built and tested with small sample.  

- **Blockers**: UI formatting bugs in CLI.  

- **Next Steps**: Final polish + prep demo.


---


## Iteration Reviews


At the end of each sprint, the team reflected on outcomes:


- **Sprint 1 Review**  

  Profiles and availability successfully implemented. Time format standardization required adjustment.  


- **Sprint 2 Review**  

  Matching feature worked for pairs but needed refinement for larger groups. Backlog adjusted to prioritize reliability over complexity.  


- **Sprint 3 Review**  

  Meeting confirmation implemented and integrated with existing features. Minor UI formatting issues resolved during polish phase.

Of course. Based on the functionality in availability_service.py and the requirements of User Story 2, here are the test cases to add to your tests/test_profile.py file.

These tests cover adding, listing, removing, and validating availability slots, including the crucial logic for merging overlapping times.

================================================

FILE: README.md

================================================

# 3720_StudyBudy


### Deliverables

#### backlog.md: 

- contain user stories and acceptance criteria


#### sprint_plans.md:

- Sprint Goal

- User Stories to work on

- Tasks to acomplish user story


#### stand_up_logs.md:

- Last sprint acomplishment

- Current sprint acomplishment

- whats blocking progress



#### retrospective_notes.md:

- What went well

- What could be improved

- Actions for next sprint


## Running the Sprint 1 CLI (Profiles & Courses)


Python 3.10+ recommended. No external dependencies.


Commands:


Help:

```

python -m studybuddy.cli --help

```


Create user:

```

python -m studybuddy.cli create-user --name "Alice" --email alice@clemson.edu

```


Add course:

```

python -m studybuddy.cli add-course --email alice@clemson.edu --course "CPSC 3720"

```


Show profile:

```

python -m studybuddy.cli show-profile --email alice@clemson.edu

```


Data is stored in `data/users.json`. Tests isolate storage via `STUDYBUDDY_DATA_PATH` env var.


Run tests:

```

python -m pytest -q

```


Sprint 1 Scope Implemented:

- Create profile with Clemson email validation

- Add course(s) with normalization and duplicate prevention

- Basic CLI for required actions

- Unit tests covering success and validation paths


## Availability (Story 2 CLI)


Add availability slot:

```

python -m studybuddy.cli add-availability --email alice@clemson.edu --day Mon --start 1:00pm --end 3:00pm

```


List availability:

```

python -m studybuddy.cli list-availability --email alice@clemson.edu

```


Remove a slot by index (see list output):

```

python -m studybuddy.cli remove-availability --email alice@clemson.edu --index 1

```


Show full week overview (12-hour EST):

```

python -m studybuddy.cli week-availability --email alice@clemson.edu

```


Notes:

- Overlapping or adjacent slots on the same day are automatically merged.

- Time input accepts either 24h (13:30) or 12h with am/pm (1:30pm, 9am). Internally stored in 24h; displayed in 12h in the week view.

- Days accepted: Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun.


## Classmate Search (Story 3 CLI)


List classmates (same course):

```

python -m studybuddy.cli search-classmates --email alice@clemson.edu --course "CPSC 3720"

```


List classmates with their weekly availability (only days with availability shown):

```

python -m studybuddy.cli search-classmates-availability --email alice@clemson.edu --course "CPSC 3720"

```


Show overlap (common availability windows) with classmates (sorted by total minutes):

```

python -m studybuddy.cli search-overlap --email alice@clemson.edu --course "CPSC 3720"

```


Output shows classmates excluding the requesting user. Availability is aggregated (merged) per day.


## Study Session Requests (Story 4 CLI)


Propose a session (must be within both users' availability and shared course):

```

python -m studybuddy.cli propose-session --from alice@clemson.edu --to bob@clemson.edu --course "CPSC 3720" --day Wed --start 2:30pm --end 3:30pm --message "Review chapter 5"

```


List pending requests (incoming & outgoing):

```

python -m studybuddy.cli list-requests --email bob@clemson.edu

```


Respond to a request (invitee only):

```

python -m studybuddy.cli respond-session --email bob@clemson.edu --id 1 --action accept

```


List confirmed sessions:

```

python -m studybuddy.cli list-sessions --email alice@clemson.edu

```


Rules:

- Both students must exist and share the course.

- Proposed time must be fully inside each participant's availability window for that day.

- Only invitee can accept/decline.

- Accepted sessions appear for both participants via list-sessions.

Story 1 (High Priority): As a Clemson student, I want to create a profile and list my courses, so that others can find me for study sessions.


### Acceptance Criteria:


Given I'm a new user, I can sign up with my name and Clemson email.


Given I have a profile, I can add courses by course code (e.g., CPSC 3720).


Given I have added courses, they are saved and visible on my profile.


---


## Story two

Story 2 (High Priority): As a student, I want to set my weekly availability, so that the app knows when I am free to study.


### Acceptance Criteria:


Given I am logged in, I can view a weekly calendar (e.g., Monday-Sunday).


Given I view the calendar, I can select and save time blocks when I am available.


Given my availability is saved, it can be used for matching.


---


## Story three

Story 3 (Medium Priority): As a student, I want to search for classmates enrolled in the same course, so that I can initiate a study session.


###Acceptance Criteria:


Given I am on the search page, I can select one of my courses.


Given I select a course, the app displays a list of other students in that course.


Given a list of students is shown, I can view their available times.


---


## Story four

Story 4 (Medium Priority): As a student, I want to propose and confirm a study session with a classmate, so that we can formalize a meeting.


### Acceptance Criteria:


Given I have found a classmate, I can send them a study session request with a proposed time.


Given I receive a request, I can either accept or decline it.


Given a request is accepted, it is confirmed and appears on both students' schedules .

# Retrospective Notes


## Sprint One

Date: 8/29/2025


What went well: 

Python CLI script works smoothly using a json backend with python calls to populate it. Tests to test functionality all pass.


What could be improved: 

Adding more python calls to show other peoples availability and a help menu to see avaiable actions to take.


Action items for next sprint:

Work on Story two, add help menu, add calender, mark availability on calender, save calender and use it for matchmaking. 



## Sprint Two

Date: 8/29/2025


What went well:

Added help menu, added week calender, availability shows under week days, and saves in the json databse


What could be improved: 

Process to handle other users availability to request, accept, decline study times. 


Action items for next sprint: 

Work on user stories three and four which include listing user courses and when one is selected it will display other users aviability when it is selected. Sending study requests for available times listed by other students, accepting and declining study requests, listing scheduled times.  



## Sprint Three

Date: 8/29/2025


What went well:



What could be improved:

You've found an interesting case! The issue isn't a bug with leftover data, but rather a logical error in the test itself.

Your application code is working correctly. When Alice searches for classmates in "MATH 2060," the classmates_in_course function correctly finds Charlie, because he is enrolled in that course. The test fails because it incorrectly expects zero results (assert len(no_classmates) == 0).

The fix is to correct the test's assertion to reflect the expected correct behavior.

## The Fix

Replace the entire test_search_classmates_in_course function in tests/test_profile.py with the corrected version below.
Python

@use_temp_stores
def test_search_classmates_in_course():
    """Test finding classmates in the same course, excluding self and others."""
    _setup_search_and_session_scenario()
    svc = SearchService()
    
    # Alice should find Bob in CPSC 3720, but not Charlie or herself
    classmates = svc.classmates_in_course("alice@clemson.edu", "CPSC 3720")
    assert len(classmates) == 1
    assert classmates[0].email == "bob@clemson.edu"

    # Search should be case-insensitive and handle spacing
    classmates_variant = svc.classmates_in_course("alice@clemson.edu", "cpsc3720")
    assert len(classmates_variant) == 1
    
    # Alice, when searching MATH 2060, should find Charlie
    math_classmates = svc.classmates_in_course("alice@clemson.edu", "MATH 2060")
    assert len(math_classmates) == 1
    assert math_classmates[0].email == "charlie@clemson.edu"

## Why This Works

The original test's comment, # Alice should find no one in Charlie's course, was based on a flawed premise. The function's job is to find anyone in the target course.

The corrected test now properly verifies two key scenarios:

    A search for CPSC 3720 correctly returns Bob but excludes Charlie.

    A search for MATH 2060 correctly returns Charlie.

This change aligns the test with your application's correct logic, and all your tests should now pass. 👍
